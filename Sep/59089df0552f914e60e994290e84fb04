Love Books is a top spot to nab a beach read, order a new biography or assemble for the launch of the latest local bestseller that’s going to upset Twitter. Melville’s beloved bookdealer has just been named the best independent bookseller for 2019 at the Sefika SA Book Awards. For those out of the literary loop, they are the big fish of local publishing and book gongs. And, if perchance you’ve been living in a reading wasteland for the past 10 years, you should know that Love Books is a marvellous, friendly, owner-run store that is wall-to-wall with the best fiction and nonfiction, art books, cookery tomes, good magazines, loads of home-grown stuff and a fantastic kids section. It’s a bibliophile’s nirvana.
