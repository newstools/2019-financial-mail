It is apparent from his answers to Giulietta Talevi (Money & Investing August 29-September 4) that Discovery Health CEO Jonathan Broomberg’s grasp of lobbying strategy is even worse than his grasp of government’s National Health Insurance (NHI) policy. Broomberg echoes the ideas and tone of the mining industry at the time it lost its mineral rights. As was the case in that industry, Broomberg proposes to go along with the government, falling directly into the trap set for him, as the government understands it cannot dismantle SA’s health industry without buy-in from the industry itself. Today, leading mining CEOs describe SA as uninvestable. Broomberg’s lead will help facilitate a similar catastrophe for our health-care industry. SA’s farmers, on the other hand, after a year of appeasement in the aftermath of the ANC’s decision on expropriation without compensation (EWC) at its Nasrec conference, have changed tack and as a result are in a much stronger position to challenge EWC. After 15 years of working in this field, I remain amazed at how poorly large corporations understand the nature and ideology of the ruling party, or the strategy and tactics used to pursue it. The pursuit of NHI, for example, is not about better health-care services, but about equal health-care services — which means that budget constraints are irrelevant to the government. Private sector efficiency is of little import if ideology dictates that the state should direct all strategic sectors of the economy. Appeasement fails when your opponent respects only forthrightness and the demonstration of strength of character in defending a line in the sand. Because none of this is on display from health-related corporations, SA’s main hope to curb the negative effects of NHI is for our country’s doctors to organise themselves in effective opposition.
