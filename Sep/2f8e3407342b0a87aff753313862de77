Hot but unbothered The US is a clear outlier in terms of public scepticism of the threat of climate change, according to a survey released ahead of a major UN climate summit in New York where 60 heads of state are expected to make new climate pledges. They will not include US President Donald Trump, however. The survey found that 15% of Americans believe either that the climate is not changing at all, or that it is not changing due to human causes. This figure is the highest of any country in the world, and almost three times the global average. Financial Times Doves on the wing Emerging-market central banks are more dovish than at any point since at least the global financial crisis, according to Bank of America (BofA) Merrill Lynchâ€™s Emerging Monetary Mood Indicator. The survey is based on robotic scanning of keywords used in the publications of 11 big emerging-market central banks. BofA says the dovishness should be supportive for emerging-market equities and bonds, but not currencies. Financial Times
