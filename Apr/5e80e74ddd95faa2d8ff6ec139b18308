If someone came to you tomorrow with R100m to invest in just one company, which would it be? It would be a listed investment company in Kenya called Centum. It holds a portfolio of investments that gives you broad access to the real economy of Kenya and is currently trading at half of its NAV. What was your first job? A brand girl for Sandton City, which entailed dressing up in a fancy Jenni Button suit and handing out leaflets to customers. If you could fix one thing in SA today, what would it be? I would give every South African an equal footing when it came to quality education. Further to that, I would make sure enough jobs were created or enough support given to SMEs to employ these educated young people. What’s the best investment you’ve ever made? A cement company in China many years ago. It was eventually bought out by a much larger cement company as the market consolidated. And the worst? Buying property at the top of the market and selling out of Capitec shares to fund the purchase. What’s your favourite song? Hotel California by The Eagles. What is your most treasured possession? My pillow. What travel experience is on your bucket list? A once-in-a-lifetime trip for me would be a Trans-Siberian Railway tour. On what occasion do you lie? When my kids ask me if I just swore. Name a place you’ve been to that lives up to the hype? Santorini, an island off the coast of Greece. It really is as beautiful and romantic as photos suggest. Do you own bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies? Why? Yes, I own an ethereum — purely so that I don’t feel left out of the craze. What was your last purchase? A leotard for my three-year-old’s gym class. If you could turn back time, what would you change in your life? I would not have stopped piano lessons in primary school. It is far more difficult to learn when you are older, with less time to practise and a more preoccupied mind.
