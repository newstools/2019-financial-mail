Boschendal has just released a new red wine. We sampled it with dinner and were impressed. The Nicolas 2016 is a combination of shiraz, petit verdot, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, malbec and cabernet franc. Most of the grapes used to make these varietals were grown in Stellenbosch, the rest in the Swartland. Once vinified, they were blended to create this classic, elegant offering. And the name? Nicolas de Lanoy was one of the founding pioneers of the 334-year-old Boschendal farm. Worth a try.
