SA’s Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator has won the 2019 Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship for pioneering innovative solutions to the challenge of youth unemployment. Led by founder Nicola Galombik and CEO Maryana Iskander, the not-for-profit organisation has generated more than 100,000 jobs for unemployed youth in SA and Rwanda. Founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Jeff Skoll, the award recognises innovations that have had a significant impact on the world’s most pressing problems. From Free State premier to provincial ANC chair, Ace Magashule, the governing party’s secretary-general, had another, less welcome, title thrust on him. The new moniker associated with the face of the ANC is (alleged) "gangster", after extracts of an explosive new book were published in the Sunday papers. Investigative reporter Pieter-Louis Myburgh’s Gangster State zones in on Magashule and his dealings in the Free State, painting an all but rosy picture of him mere weeks ahead of the general election.
