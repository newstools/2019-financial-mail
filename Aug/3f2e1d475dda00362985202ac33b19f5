If someone came to you tomorrow with R100m to invest in just one company, which would it be? Samsung Electronics. With 5G being rolled out globally, Samsung is the dominant player in supplying the 5G base stations. And 5G requires four times more base stations than 4G in order to work. What’s the wisest thing you could tell your 20-year-old self that you didn’t know when you started out? That markets are engineered to go up over time and shorting is a tortuous affair. Which talent would you most like to have? To turn back time. What was your first job? And how much were you paid? I was a barman on a beach in Ios Island (next to Santorini). I was paid in beers, tips and extras. If you could fix one thing in SA today, what would it be and how would you start doing that? Education. Unfortunately, throwing money at it is how you have to start. Who do you admire in the investment community and why? Paul Tudor Jones. I saw an old documentary of him called Trader (1987). It convinced me to get on a plane to pursue my dream. What’s the worst investment mistake you’ve made? Knowing I’m wrong and staying wrong. What’s the best investment you’ve ever made? And how much of it was due to luck? Nearly every investment decision requires an element of luck and if your broker tells you otherwise, they’re lying. Would you buy or rent your primary home? Buy. If you weren’t a portfolio manager, what would your dream job be? Refer to question 4. How do you control your emotions when all you want to do is sell or buy a share, but you know you shouldn’t? I don’t. Buying and selling shares should never be emotional. What is your greatest extravagance? Too much good coffee. Big Tech or old-fashioned industrial stalwart? Big Tech but wind-up watches. SA or offshore? Both. Facebook, Twitter or Instagram? Twitter. How much of a portfolio should be for the wildcard picks? 8%. Art, wine, rare books or cars? Stamps. Do you cycle? No, I don’t — not since I saw my former colleague in Lycra.
