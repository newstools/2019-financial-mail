I am glad to see a letter to the FM complaining about the bad customer service at Edcon ("Poor Service a Big Problem for Edcon", Letters, July 11-17). I have borne the brunt of this on two occasions over the past month, both at the cosmetics department. Upon inquiring to purchase a certain brand of moisturiser, I was told the person responsible was not at work and there was no-one to help, but I could try Woolworths or Truworths. Upon complaining to management my problem was sorted out, with no apologies for my inconvenience. Management urged me to return to the store for the product I sought. While there, I wanted to buy some men’s fragrance, which was on special with an overnight bag. This bag was out of stock. The store promised to source it and call me. That was three weeks ago, and there’s been no call. When one has to try so hard to spend money on luxury goods in a country where the economy is waning, one wonders why Edcon has not jacked up its customer services — especially on those goods that don’t fly off the shelves. Judging from this experience, the Public Investment Corp funding does, indeed, seem to be a waste, or perhaps too easily acquired. S BeukesCape Town The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
