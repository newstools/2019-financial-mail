The annual cornucopia of lovely things that is 100% Design South Africa takes place on August 8-11 at Midrand’s Gallagher Convention Centre. It’s always a hub of creativity. What are we most looking forward to at the show? Laduma Ngxokolo is 2019’s feature designer of the year. His range, Maxhosa, a contemporary interpretation of traditional Xhosa motifs (in both fashion and interiors) is all the rage abroad right now. He’ll be displaying everything from rugs to upholstery to wallpaper, and a couple of other hot new developments too. Haldane Martin is a longtime leader in SA design. and his interior projects and furniture designs are acclaimed locally and internationally. At this year’s 100% Design, he’s created the 100% Lounge space. As the name suggests, it’s a chic space to, well, sit and relax. We’re utterly mad about his new Cha Cha tables and extended Hula Range of outdoor furniture — the latter is wonderfully retro. Clout Café is the brainchild of creative director Tracy Lee Lynch of Studio Leelynch. It’s fired up by Nando’s — which is no surprise, given that Lynch is one of the geniuses behind the chicken brand’s fantastic, proudly local interiors. The café is a spot to socialise and will showcase a bevy of products curated by Lynch. She always unearths the next big names in SA design talent, so this is something you don’t want to miss.
