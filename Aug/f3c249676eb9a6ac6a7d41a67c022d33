I find it so sad that President Cyril Ramaphosa will not simply yield to the most obvious path to guarantee his future and that of SA: embrace the old white guard and its successes. In so doing, he could sidle up to the DA, forming a formidable coalition that would withstand attacks both from within his party and from the EFF. For everyone who leaves the country we lose a taxpayer and a job creator, never mind expertise. And Ramaphosa’s job just keeps getting harder.
