Have you ever logged in to your Netflix account, clicked through to BoxOffice or browsed your Showmax options and thought: "How is it that I can’t find anything I want to watch?" It’s stupefying, really. So many possible TV shows and movies at the tip of our remote control these days, and yet somehow there’s often little of value amid the endless low-budget dreck and wretched reality shows. You finish bingeing Veep and then you’re left bereft, lost in the filmic wilderness. Do we have too much choice? Is this a moment for some introspection on the part of us oversaturated but unexcited viewers? Remember the days of being content with just three terrestrial TV channels? Some might say that recommending yet another streaming service merely adds to the digital clutter and our deepening dependence. Truthfully, though, if you’re a fan of English period pieces, whodunits and dramas, you probably want to know about Acorn TV. This US platform specialises in good British stuff. The offering is small in SA but pretty decent for R79 a month, and it got me thinking that I’d far rather subscribe to something that’s targeted to my likes than a free-for-all of made-for-TV movies about Meghan and Harry and motivational talk shows. On Acorn I’ve just watched a delightful season of Agatha Christie’s Partners in Crime, which stars David Walliams (of Little Britain fame) and Jessica Raine (Jenny Lee in the early years of Call the Midwife) as a mystery-solving husband and wife. You’ll also find Doc Martin, Foyle’s War and the BBC’s adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent. Next on my list? The Indian Doctor, which stars Sanjeev Bhaskar (from The Kumars at No 42) as an MD who moves to a Welsh village in the 1960s. Hours of charming viewing ahead, don’t you think? • Acorn.tv
