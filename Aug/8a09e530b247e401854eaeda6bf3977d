I would love to know how brand values ("Embrace the Brand", Media & Advertising, July 18-24), are calculated, particularly in the case of cellphone companies. It surely cannot be from good service or a value-for-money offering, or sponsoring unsuccessful rugby teams. A quick visit to the Vodacom complaints platform on Facebook reveals a raft of unhappy customers with a variety of complaints — far too many to list here. The other bugbear is that a voice bundle expires at month-end and unused minutes are forfeited. I have it on good authority that the petrol companies are investigating a system whereby any fuel in your petrol tank at month-end evaporates, forcing you back to the service station to refuel. The government often talks about the "data must fall" demand, but there should be a wider form of investigation into the telecoms industry — an industry that does a masterful impersonation of the highwaymen of yesteryear, except that the guns have been replaced with corporate suits and frilly advertising. Cellphone companies are laughing all the way to the bank as they prey on the uneducated masses. Tony BallGillitts The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
