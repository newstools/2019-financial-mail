1. Quick on the draw New Zealand is leading the way in showing what is possible when it comes to gun control. Just weeks after the March 15 Christchurch shooting, in which 51 people died, parliament outlawed assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons by a vote of 119-1, and set aside NZ$150m to buy back outlawed firearms. Now, less than a month after the buyback scheme launched, more than 10,000 firearms have been handed in, The Guardian reports. Gun owners have until December 20 to comply with the legislation. 2. Fashion faux pas Luxury brand Versace has issued a grovelling apology to China after its T-shirts caused a social media storm there. The shirts listed city-country pairs such as "Milan-Italy", "Paris-France" — and, problematically, "Hong Kong-Hong Kong", and "Macau-Macau", suggesting the two regions are independent of China, according to the BBC. It’s a particularly sensitive subject for China, which keeps a close guard on issues of sovereignty. "It’s our company’s negligence and we express deep apology for the impact it caused," Versace reportedly said on Chinese site Weibo. "We love China and resolutely respect China’s territory and sovereignty." 3. Kashmir clampdown Eid-al-Adha seems to have been a low-key affair in Kashmir this week, amid a curfew, a communications blackout and a ban on large congregations of people. Tensions have been high since the Indian government earlier this month revoked the autonomy of Kashmir — India’s only Muslim-majority state — as well as the rules preventing outsiders from buying land there. While Kashmiris were allowed to visit mosques for prayers, The Guardian reported that the security crackdown left them unable to visit friends and relatives, as is traditional on this important Islamic celebration.
