Capetonians craving a measure of culture should make haste to Welgemeend for its Art Month. The historic manor on the grounds of the city’s Hoërskool Jan van Riebeeck was built in 1693. This August, the lovely old heritage house is playing host to a decidedly modern celebration of art. The charity initiative was started in 2014 by Lizelle and Frank Kilbourn, the executive chair of auction house Strauss & Co, in an effort to preserve the heritage building. Five years on and the endeavour is going strong and offering a fantastic array of talks, films and, of course, art. Take for example the masterclass by Strauss & Co on August 17, titled "How to Look at a Painting and Make Sense of It". The following day, there’s a recital by Qden Blaauw, Jordan Brooks and Gerhard Joubert — three of SA’s promising young classical music talents. Running throughout the month at the homestead is the exhibition Satire and Irony. It features paintings by Robert Hodgins, Stanley Pinker and Alexander Podlashuc plus sculptures by Peter Haden. The works are on loan from art heavy hitters like the Kilbourns, Marion and Jonathan Bloch (the latter of Investec fame) and Caro Wiese (wife of businessman Christo, director of Strauss & Co and a prolific art collector). • For more info and tickets visit welgemeendart.co.za
