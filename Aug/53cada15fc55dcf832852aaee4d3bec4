Regarding "A Fiscal Unravelling" of SA (Cover Story, August 15-21): absolutely nothing will change in SA until the ANC is replaced. Anyone who can’t see this is in for a shock. President Cyril Ramaphosa, like his predecessors, places the ANC above SA in order for the party to stay in power at any cost. If SA burns, it’s too bad. Ramaphosa is a lame-duck president who comes out every once in a while to make ludicrous statements, such as "We will turn the economy around whether you like it or not". He is too weak to take decisions and fire the people in his government who need to be fired. Even worse, thousands should have been fired from Eskom — but no such thing has happened. He’s obviously waiting for permission from the unions, which will never happen. The "new" National Prosecuting Authority hasn’t arrested a single person for state capture, or for corruption at Eskom and other state-owned enterprises — even with all the proof that has been available for years now. It’s unbelievable; almost fiction. The various commissions of inquiry were not set up because Ramaphosa wanted to fix SA; their main goal was to ensure the ANC won the election. We are heading for destruction as long as the ANC stays in power. The Economist magazine should apologise to SA for pushing for Ramaphosa for president — that was a big mistake.
