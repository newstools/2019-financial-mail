1. Bashir faces the music Deposed Sudanese strongman Omar al-Bashir is in court this week on charges of corruption. The former president, who was ousted in a coup in April, is facing charges of "possessing foreign currency, corruption and receiving gifts illegally", according to The Guardian. It says there is no word yet on whether he will be charged for human rights violations, though activists are hopeful these will follow. Meanwhile, citizens celebrated in the streets of Khartoum this weekend after the ruling military council and civil society groups came to an agreement on the transition to civilian rule. 2. Code red Britain looks set for a grim future if it leaves the EU without a deal in place: shortages of food, medicine and fuel, jammed ports, and a hard border with Ireland. This is according to secret cabinet memos leaked to the UK Sunday Times. Dubbed "Operation Yellowhammer", the memos sketch the likely fallout of a no-deal Brexit (rather than a worst-case scenario). It should set off alarm bells, given Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s brinkmanship. He has vowed to take the UK out of the EU come October 31, regardless of whether a deal is in place. 3. Air grievances The area around the Mpumalanga town of Kriel has the dubious distinction of being the second-worst sulphur dioxide hotspot in the world. A new study by Greenpeace India, which tracked SO² emissions using data from Nasa satellites, puts Kriel behind the Russian city of Norilsk and ahead of the Zagros petrochemical complex in Iran. It blames the high concentration of coal-fired power stations in the area. In a separate study conducted in the third quarter of last year, Greenpeace found Mpumalanga also had the world’s worst nitrogen dioxide emissions from power plants, according to news agency Bloomberg.
