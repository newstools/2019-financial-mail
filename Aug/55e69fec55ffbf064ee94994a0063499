The FM cover "Enemy of the State?" (August 1-7), about public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, warrants a response. An enemy of the state is a person accused of crimes against the state such as treason. The term suggests that a person who conspires or incites others to attempt to overthrow the lawfully constituted government, alter the laws or policy of the country by force, usurp the power of the government, or incite invasion, will be guilty of treason. To equate a high-ranking legal officer with an enemy of the state is preposterous. Certain sections of our judiciary and law enforcement institutions are already under duress. We must be wary of demonising those legal opinions we disagree with. The public protector is not perfect, and our judges are not perfect, but to label any one of them an enemy of the state is tantamount to walking blindfolded through a minefield.
