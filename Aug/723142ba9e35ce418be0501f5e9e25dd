President Cyril Ramaphosa has my full support. The DA must stop politicking and put SA first. Public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane reminds me of a quote by Bharat Nain: "Credibility and lack of credibility both need consistency, one for reliability and the other for the lack of it." The public protector has consistently been found to be not credible — for example, finding "no wrongdoing" in the controversial Vrede dairy farm project in the Free State, "despite 510 missing cows". Unsurprisingly, the Pretoria high court ruled that she had failed in her duties to investigate and report on the dairy project. Further, she rather "ignorantly" instructed that the central bank’s mandate be amended. In addition, her Bankorp finding was overturned. I think it is time that she be "overturned", as her work is nothing short of negligent, with findings that border on fantasy. She is a disgrace to her once respected office.
