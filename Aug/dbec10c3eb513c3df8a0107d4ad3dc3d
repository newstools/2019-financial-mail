A good week After perennial calls for him to make way for new blood, the once controversial IFP leader and former KwaZulu chief minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi finally stepped down as president of the party he founded 44 years ago.

"The story of the IFP is deeply intertwined with my own story; the story of Buthelezi," he observed, adding that the party "has a future beyond my own". His successor, Velenkosini Hlabisa, was groomed to take over and is unlikely to change tack.

Powell, speaking at the Fed’s annual economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, dared to suggest there was little the central bank could do to counteract Trump’s trade war with China, which was fuelling economic anxiety. "My only question is," Trump raged on Twitter with his trademark contempt for norms such as the bank’s independence, "who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?"
