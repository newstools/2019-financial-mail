A good week Current Premier Soccer League player’s player and footballer of the season Thembinkosi Lorch was named the man of the match after his 85th-minute goal for Bafana Bafana knocked hosts and favourites Egypt out of the Africa Cup of Nations competition and kept SA hopes alive. SA’s 1-0 win in the last-16 game stunned the rest of Africa. SA sports fans, dejected by Banyana Banyana’s crashing out of the women’s Soccer World Cup and the Proteas’ early exit from the Cricket World Cup, were elated. For days, at least. A bad week After 67 years of rollicking irreverence, Mad magazine has become the latest victim of the digital era. The humour rag’s circulation reached more than 2-million in the 1970s.
