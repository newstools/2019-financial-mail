Lisa Steyn’s article on deep-sea mining (Features, July 11-17) refers. I am almost disappointed in myself for being surprised by the new lows to which humanity will sink for a quick buck. In our ever-growing greed and quest for minerals, we are not satisfied with carving up the planet’s surface; now we must insist on adding more trauma — and, inevitably, trash — to our oceans? Steyn writes that the International Seabed Authority must come up with a deep-sea mining code by next year. Well, I hope that code states that for every ton of "treasure" harvested from the ocean, the government or corporation responsible has to clean up a ton of plastic and trash with it. We are already killing unprecedented amounts of aquatic life. I am devastated at the thought of the ecological implications of even one of these mining claims for this already fragile and abused ecosystem. Why can’t we just leave it alone?
