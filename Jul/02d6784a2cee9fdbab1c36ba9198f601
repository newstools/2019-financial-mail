The Sanell Aggenbach show that opens this week at Everard Read’s CIRCA Gallery in Joburg is one you don’t want to miss. The FM got a sneak peek of the exhibition, The Heart Has Many Rooms, and we think it’s grand. Its paintings and sculptures are divided into rooms, separated over the gallery’s two floors. In this way, the show negotiates Aggenbach’s affections — downstairs, the private affairs of the heart, and above that, the devotion of a mother and child. Our standout works? The Atlas series of large oil on canvas paintings that depict unmade bed linen, that serve as a form of abstract eroticism. Oh, and of course the fantastic Madre Pietà. Cast in bronze, it’s a knockout. The show runs until August 24. everard-read.co.za
