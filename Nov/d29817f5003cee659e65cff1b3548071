A good week A Brazilian supreme court ruling that a defendant may be jailed only after all appeals have been exhausted led to the release of popular former leftist president Lula da Silva, pending an appeal. Heâ€™d served 580 days of a nine-year sentence for corruption based on charges many believe were fabricated. Indeed, the judge who found him guilty was made justice minister by incoming far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who, opinion polls had indicated, would almost certainly have been defeated by Lula in the election a year ago. A bad week Commiserations to Jacob Zuma. The ex-president not only lost his appeal against a court order forcing him to delete a tweet in which he called ANC NEC member Derek Hanekom a "known enemy agent" but, due to illness, had to forgo the opportunity to appear for a second time before the state capture commission of inquiry. We hope he makes a speedy recovery so he can travel to Parktown in Joburg and put to rest the allegations that, he says, are part of a grand conspiracy that led to his ousting. Thoughts and prayers.
