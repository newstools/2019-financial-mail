"What Cyril Can Learn From Siya" (Editorials, November 7-13) refers. You say Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus had a plan from which he never wavered or deviated doing the recent Rugby World Cup final against England.

Has the president told you what his "plan" actually is? If so, please pass on the information. John Kane-BermanJoburg
