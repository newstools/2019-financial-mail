Former public protector Thuli Madonsela is taking the call for support of girls’ hygiene needs to new heights. On August 9, Madonsela — joined by an expedition of influential women — is scheduled to summit Mount Kilimanjaro to raise funds for the Caring4Girls menstrual hygiene programme. We’ve hardly started amplifying the narrative around the gross injustice of girls missing school due to a lack of sanitary products, which should be available at no cost to those who cannot afford them. So it’s heartening to see a woman in a leadership position "rolling up her sleeves" to help alleviate the struggles of our girls. Why should our girls continue to suffer indignity while the financially capable among us look the other way — or, worse, look on indifferently? Showing support for girls in the critical area of sanitary hygiene is a true test of our moral fibre as a society. Not to mention the legacy we’re building. Let’s not stand in the way of their development. With a good dose of creativity, generosity and compassion we can help our girls manage their periods with dignity, allowing them to focus on the critical matter of their education.
