In a column some time ago, Sikonathi Mantshantsha (Between the Chains, June 14-20 2018) lamented his missed opportunity in not participating in Vodacom’s YeboYethu empowerment investment scheme. I think differently of what his real lost opportunity was. Having just seen details of the Barloworld Khula Sizwe empowerment scheme, it is worth sharing with you. Our nanny of 25 years has just retired comfortably on the fruits of her retirement savings, thanks in large part to the amazing dividends (reinvested) and capital growth realised from schemes such as YeboYethu, MultiChoice’s Phuthuma Nathi, Telkom’s Khulisa and MTN’s Zakhele Futhi. Despite not being personally eligible to participate in these schemes, I am pleased that I was alert to them. I suppose many other employers would have been too, but there could have been more, and then there would be fewer marginalised previously (still!) disadvantaged individuals around. My point is that the bookbuilders of schemes such as these should specifically be targeting people such as Mantshantsha, myself and other employers of gardeners and domestic workers. That would really make a difference where it is needed. It is not too late for the bookbuilders — or the employers. Alan FleetwoodElsies River The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
