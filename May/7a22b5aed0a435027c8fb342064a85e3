I believe Sikonathi Mantshantsha (Between the Chains, May 16-22) is missing the main cause of unemployment in our country: the unions. Countries with weak unions have high employment. The second cause is red tape. I recently read that it took the Nanaga farm stall near Port Elizabeth more than five years to obtain a filling station licence. It now employs 50 people. The benefits of BEE were misdirected to a few, but instead should have gone into education and training. The rest of the world imports skills; SA exports them.
