A good week for ... Adcorp’s turnaround strategy under CEO Innocent Dutiro seems on track. The workforce-management company is to pay a dividend, of 96.1c a share, for the first time since 2016. Dutiro, who took the reins in October 2017, also announced a net after-tax profit of R262m for the year to February, reversing the previous year’s R561m loss. Revenue was slightly down, at R15.1bn — not bad in a flat economy with one of the highest jobless rates. Dutiro noted: "The drive to rightsize the business … is yielding positive outcomes." And a bad week for ... Shamelessly twisting the facts, former president Jacob Zuma told supporters outside the Pietermaritzburg high court that the National Prosecuting Authority had a vendetta against him — and that five judges had acquitted him of the corruption charges against him since 2004.

Odiously equating the charges against him with "apartheid justice", he insists: "There is no case against me, there never will be." We’ll see.
