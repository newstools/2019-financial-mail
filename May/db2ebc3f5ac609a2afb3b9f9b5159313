I would like to offer the DA’s Mmusi Maimane the use of my spare calculator so he can calculate the folly of his campaign promise of raising child grants from R420 to R800. In a flash he has put himself in the company of Cyril Ramaphosa and Julius Malema, with grandiose promises that smack of a lack of forethought. I believe that, as unpalatable as it seems, the government should restrict child grants. Quite simply, the population cannot grow faster than the economy, which is struggling. Promisers, promises, promises — that’s all we get from politicians and government officials before they head off to a gala dinner or banquet somewhere.
