"Desperate for Hope" (Cover Story, April 18-24) reminded me of a story from 60 years ago, about a Harlem pastor, bedecked in jewellery and robed in mink, mesmerising his congregation as they filled the collection plate in exchange for a place in heaven. Religious history is filled with charlatans; the gullible fall for the antics of false prophets who are more criminal than godly. The magnificent architecture of the cathedrals of St Paul’s and Notre-Dame, Westminster Abbey, the Dome and the Blue Mosque is dedicated to the glory of God — but those buildings house as many sinners as saints. The Almighty must shake his head in bewilderment as those empowered to broadcast his message fall short in their behaviour, ignoring teachings that are meant to lift mankind to higher spiritual levels while rejecting materialistic lives.
