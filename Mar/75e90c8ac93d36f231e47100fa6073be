"SA Sick of Being in the Dark (Editorials, March 21-27) is the collective voice of SA. Some time ago, President Cyril Ramaphosa chaired a "war room" to find a solution to the very serious problems facing Eskom. However, things have gone from bad to worse, which raises questions about the calibre of the group and its understanding of this industry. Those running the utility at the start of ANC rule anticipated the development of SA and the need for further power stations to sustain our growing economy. This was raised with president Thabo Mbeki, but it fell on deaf ears. The ANC now has no solution to the crisis. If not remedied quickly, it will cause the economy to nose-dive, with repercussions for employment. It will take years to recover from such a catastrophe.
