It’s no surprise that chef and caterer Sasha Sonnenberg-Simpson’s Rosebank restaurant, Brik, has only been open a few weeks and is already being touted as the new spot to do meetings and eat out in Joburg. Housed in a street-facing corner space in the newly revamped Rosebank fire station (the rescue service is still stationed there, by the way), it epitomises stylish simplicity with terracotta metal finishes and blonde wood details. It’s already buzzing with snappy suit-wearing types from the surrounding corporates, grabbing espressos, and cool kids typing furiously on their MacBooks. Plus, there are people going there to actually eat breakfast, lunch and dinner too. The food has contemporary Levantine and Jewish influences and the menu is small, fresh and seasonal. Breakfasts include a heavenly dish that combines a sweet-potato latke, poached egg and pastrami with a horseradish and turmeric emulsion (a sort of hollandaise). For later, meals choices include sweet-potato gnocchi served with corn, leeks, preserved lemon and labneh. Brik is not fussy. Nor is it flashy — but it is very much on par with what you’ll find in London and New York. It’s good to have another restaurant of this calibre in the City of Gold. We could do with more. • Brik, 16 Baker Street, Rosebank, Johannesburg
